## Notes
- Anything with "* " is a note
- 
- By looking through the orginal project that I'm basing my app off of, I have become more verse in the Tkinter syntax. 
  The syntax becomes easier to read and have able to launch a few test windows that I'm working currently. (* Not familiar with Tkinter library * )

- Because my lack of knowledge of the Tkinter syntax, I fell behind my goal of having it completed by 4/21/22 (* Last, Test all code together | First, Develop a main
  Inventory interface * )
