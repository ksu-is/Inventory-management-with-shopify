# Inventory-management-with-shopify

- This project aims to tackles two important tasks
    - Develop a python program that uses a GUI for inventory management.
        The program's GUI should be able to view and edit inventory from a database that contains items for sale
    - Successfully implement changes committed to database after purchases are made from Shopify
